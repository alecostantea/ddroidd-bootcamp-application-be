# Internship application portal

## Description
This is a program for an internship application portal where employers can post job listings and applicants can apply for them.

## Data Structure Breakdown
* The data structure used in this program is based on a list of employers: 
    * each employer has a list of job listings which they created
    * each job listing has a list of applicants
    * the employer and the applicant are linked through the job listing

## Next Steps
This program is a work in progress. The next steps would be:
* Integrate Spring to create a web application portal
* Write unit tests to cover as many cases as possible
